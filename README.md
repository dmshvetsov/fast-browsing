# Fast Browsing

## Chrome support

Version 46 and higher of the Chrome browser is supported by this extension

## Roadmap

- [x] scroll up & down with `k` and `l`
- [x] disable shortcut scroll in contenteditable html elements
- [ ] scroll to the top
- [ ] scroll to the bottom
- [ ] consider: scroll to the next header
- [ ] consider: scroll to the previous header
- [ ] consider: a shortcut (the Escape key?) to return to body focus, will help with contenteditable HTML elements and inputs
